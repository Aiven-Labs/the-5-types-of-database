  == I think there are 5 database shapes

  - Relational
  - Columnar
  - Document
  - Key Value
  - Graph

  Let me tell you about them (with open source examples)
]

#slide[
  == Relational

  `<picture of table>`
]

#slide[
  == Codd and relational theory

  _A brief introduction_

  ...mention normalisation and why it's interesting...

  ...the point being that we actually *know* that we can represent anything
  in an RDB (although not with a guarantee of efficiency)...
]

// But note that Codd's rules are an abstract ideal, and real databases can
// diverge from them for practical reasons

#slide[
  == Characteristics of relational databases

  - Tables and rows
  - Schema design up front
  - Transactions (pretty much always)
  - ACID (_explain *very* briefly_)
  - ...
]

// Modern RDBs can have quite sophisticated column types, including JSON/JSONB,
// arrays (and thus embedded vectors), binary blobs, _what else that's interesting?_

#slide[
  == Relational: joins

  `<picture of 2 tables, joined>`
]

#slide[
  == Queries

  *SQL*

  Standardised in ...
]

#slide[
  == Relational example 1: PostgreSQL¬Æ

  #image("images/elephant.png", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database
    system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a
    strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
  ]
]

#slide[
  == More on PostgreSQL

  - ...
]

#slide[
  == Relational example 2: SQLite

  #image("images/SQLite370_banner.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast,
    self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite
    is the most used database engine in the world.
  ]
]

#slide[
  == More on SQLite

  - A library
  - Built into the Python standard library
  - Single user
  - Use it instead of #smallcaps(all: true)[JSON]/#smallcaps(all: true)[YAML]/#smallcaps(all: true)[TOML] for storing data locally!
]

#slide[
  == When to use a relational database

  - Almost always a good place to start
  - If you want ACID compliance as a given (caveat - do check!)
  - If your data fits
]


#slide[
  == Columnar

  `<picture of table with columns slightly separated>`
]

#slide[
  == Characteristics of columnar databases

]

#slide[
  == Compressing columns

  `<picture of table with columns slightly separated, showing how they're compressed>`
]

#slide[
  == Columnar example: ClickHouse¬Æ

  #image("images/ClickHouse_Logo_Black_FNL.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse")[github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse]
    ],
    [
      ClickHouse¬Æ is an open-source column-oriented database management
      system that allows generating analytical data reports in real-time.
    ]
  )

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://clickhouse.com")[clickhouse.com]
    ],
    [
      ClickHouse is the fastest and most resource efficient real-time
      data warehouse and open-source database.
    ]
  )

]

#slide[
  == Queries

  *SQL*

  _Is it an SQL variant for ClickHouse?_
]

#slide[
  == More about ClickHouse
]

#slide[
  == When to use a columnar database

  _Need to work on this!_

  - When you have lots of columns but queries return only a few
  - When you have a lot of data
  - When denormalised data is an advantate
]

#slide[
  == Document

  `<picture of a JSON document>`
]

#slide[
  == Characteristics of document databases

]

#slide[
  == Document example: OpenSearch¬Æ

  #image("images/opensearch_logo_default.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    OpenSearch is an open-source, enterprise-grade search and observability
    suite that brings order to unstructured data at scale
  ]
]

#slide[
  == Queries

  HTTP requests JSON structures
]

#slide[
  == More about OpenSearch

  - Technology origins in document processing, indexing and searching over large bodies of text
  - Designed to be distributed - scaling *horizontally*
  - Backed by #link("https://lucene.apache.org/")[Apache Lucene]
  - Queries are written in JSON
  - Schema design up front is optional - it will deduce a schema for you
]

// The Lucene project was started in 1999!
//
// "Lucene Core is a Java library providing powerful indexing and search
// features, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced
// analysis/tokenization capabilities. The PyLucene sub project provides
// Python bindings for Lucene Core."
//
// OpenSearch deducing the schema for you can have all the problems you
// should expect that to give!

#slide[
  == When to use a document database
]

#slide[
  == Key Value

  `<picture of a dictionary üôÇ >`
]

#slide[
  == Characteristics of key value databases

]

#slide[
  == Key Value example: Valkey‚Ñ¢

  #image("images/valkey-horizontal.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that
    supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can
    act as a primary database.
  ]
]

#slide[
  == Queries

  Its own protocol, with its own CLI

  It's actually rather lovely...
]

#slide[
  == More about ValKey

  - Think like a Python dictionary!
  - "Obvious" use is for caching
    - but there's much more than that, including some nice pub/sub messaging support
]

#slide[
  == When to use a key value database
]

// Remember, nice programmers don't let other programmers do messaging using an RDB,
// but ValKey is a sensible option

#slide[
  == Graph

  `<picture of object graph>`, *not* `picture of XY data graph`
]

// I mean, this slide is way too long
#slide[
  == Characteristics of graph databases

  - Objects and relations (or nodes and edge, or ...)
    - _what does Neo4J call them?_
  - Objects can have attributes
  - Relations can have attributes (well, ask me afterwards about my opinion!)
  - Relations are (should be) bidirectional
]

#slide[
  == Graph database schemas
  - Objects have a type which says what relationships and attributes they can have
  - Relations have a type (name?) which says what object types they can relate, and what attributes they can have
  - Relations are 1:1 or 1:many (and thus many:1 because bidirectional!)
]

// Gothic and my own experience, but briefly

#slide[
  == Graph example: Neo4J¬Æ

  #image("images/neo4j-logo.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://neo4j.com")[neo4j.com]
    ],
    [
      the world's most-loved graph database
    ]
  )

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j")[github.com/neo4j/neo4j]
    ],
    [
      Neo4j is the world‚Äôs leading Graph Database. It is a high performance
      graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust
      database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions.    ]
  )
]

#slide[
  == More about Neo4J

  Another quote

  #quote[
    The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and
    relationships rather than static tables‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyet enjoys all the benefits of
    enterprise-quality database.
