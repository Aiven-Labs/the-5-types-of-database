  - But want indexing

  - And rich querying

  - /*OLTP -*/ Store and query rather than update

  == More about OpenSearch

  - Technology origins in document processing, indexing and searching for large bodies of text

  - Backed by #link("https://lucene.apache.org/")[Apache Lucene]

  - Queries are written in JSON

  - Schema design up front is optional
    - but sometimes advised

  - Data visualisation tools built in

// The Lucene project was started in 1999!
//
// "Lucene Core is a Java library providing powerful indexing and search
// features, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced
// analysis/tokenization capabilities. The PyLucene sub project provides
// Python bindings for Lucene Core."
//
// OpenSearch deducing the schema for you can have all the problems you
// should expect that to give!

  ```
  HGET "book:This Book" author

// Use `OBJECT ENCODING key` to find out the internal encoding of the Valkey object stored at `key`

#slide[
  == More about Valkey

  - In-memory, but persistent to disk

  - Use cases include:

    - Data storage and retrieval

    - Caching, leveraging the value expiry support

    - Pub/Sub messaging (`SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `PUBLISH`)

    - Streams (append-only log) for message queues (`XADD`, `XREAD`)
]

#slide[
  == When to use a key value database

  - When your data fits the "key" -> "value" idea

  - Caching (for instance, URL -> page results)

  - Valkey:
    - when you want your data to expire
    - pub/sub messaging
    - message queues
    - for its datatypes

// Remember, nice programmers don't let other programmers do messaging using an RDB,

  == Relationships

  Relationships

  - are between nodes

/*
    - *may* be single or bidirectional
*/
    - *may* have properties

// https://dzone.com/articles/modelling-data-neo4j
// Given that, and because it's a detail relating to a dead system,

  == ACID and transactions

  - *Atomic* \
    each transaction is a "unit" that succeeds or fails completely
  - *Consistent* \
    each transaction takes the db from one consistent state to another
  - *Isolated* \
    concurrent transactions result as if they had been sequential
  - *Durable* \
    once a transaction is committed, it stays committed\
    (even if the database falls over)

  - *Consistent* \
