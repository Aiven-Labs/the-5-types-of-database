#slide[
  == Shapes, kinds...
  I think of databases as separated by their *shape*

  ...the way they hold their data

  And that gives me 5 shapes to talk about
]

#slide[
  == The five kinds of database I'll look at

  - Relational
  - Columnar
  - Document
  - Key Value
  - Graph

  with open source examples of each
]

#slide[
  == Relational

  `<picture of table>`
]

#slide[
  == Relational example 1: PostgreSQL¬Æ

  #image("images/elephant.png", height:50pt)

  #quote[ PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database
    system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a
    strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. ]
  ]

#slide[
  == Relational example 1: sqlite

  #image("images/sqlite370_banner.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast,
    self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite
    is the most used database engine in the world.
  ]
]


#slide[
  == Columnar

  `<picture of table with columns slightly separated, maybe compressed>`
]

#slide[
  == Columnar example: ClickHouse¬Æ

  #image("images/ClickHouse_Logo_Black_FNL.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse")[github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse]
    ],
    [
      ClickHouse¬Æ is an open-source column-oriented database management
      system that allows generating analytical data reports in real-time.
    ]
  )

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://clickhouse.com")[clickhouse.com]
    ],
    [
      ClickHouse is the fastest and most resource efficient real-time
      data warehouse and open-source database.
    ]
  )

]

#slide[
  == Document

  `<picture of a JSON document>`
]

#slide[
  == Document example: OpenSearch¬Æ

  #image("images/opensearch_logo_default.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    OpenSearch is an open-source, enterprise-grade search and observability
    suite that brings order to unstructured data at scale
  ]
]

#slide[
  == OpenSearch considerations

  - Designed to be distributed - scaling *horizontally*
  - Backed by #link("https://lucene.apache.org/")[Apache Lucene]
  - Queries are written in JSON
]

// The Lucene project was started in 1999!
//
// "Lucene Core is a Java library providing powerful indexing and search
// features, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced
// analysis/tokenization capabilities. The PyLucene sub project provides
// Python bindings for Lucene Core."

#slide[
  == Key Value

  `<picture of a dictionary üôÇ >`
]

#slide[
  == Key Value example: Valkey‚Ñ¢

  #image("images/valkey-horizontal.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[
    Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that
    supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can
    act as a primary database.
  ]
]

#slide[
  == Graph

  `<picture of object graph>`, *not* `picture of XY data graph`
]

#slide[
  == Graph example: Neo4J¬Æ

  #image("images/neo4j-logo.svg", height:50pt)

  #quote[Graphs for Everyone]
  #quote[the world's most-loved graph database]

  #quote(
    attribution: [
      #link("https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j")[github.com/neo4j/neo4j]
    ],
    [
      Neo4j is the world‚Äôs leading Graph Database. It is a high performance
      graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust
      database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The
      programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and
      relationships rather than static tables‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyet enjoys all the benefits of
