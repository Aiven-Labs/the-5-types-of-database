## Abstract

What database should you choose? Worse, what *kind* of database should you choose?

My aim is to give you enough information to make that choice, or at least be
aware of what the alternatives are.

I'd argue that there are five important database types at the moment, differing
in how they regard the "shape" of their data. I'll give a brief introduction to
each, explaining how it works, and discuss why you might want to use that
particular type of database, depending on your data and what you want to do
with it. I'll show case at least one open source example of each.

I'll cover:

* Relational (PostgreSQL®, SQLite)
* Columnar (ClickHouse®)
* Document (OpenSearch®)
* Key Value (Valkey™️)
* and as an extra, Graph (Neo4J®)
